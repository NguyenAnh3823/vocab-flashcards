Vocabulary Flashcards
=====================

Files:
- vocabulary.json : your vocabulary data grouped by Day (Day 1, Day 2, ...)
- index.html      : single-file React app (uses React via CDN). Open this in a browser to use the app.

How to use:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open index.html in Chrome/Edge/Firefox (double-click). The app will load vocabulary.json automatically.
3. Click a card to flip. Click 🔊 to hear pronunciation.

Notes:
- Days are created by grouping ~40 words per Day automatically (heuristic).
- Parsing is heuristic-based; please check vocabulary.json and let me know if some entries are mis-parsed.
